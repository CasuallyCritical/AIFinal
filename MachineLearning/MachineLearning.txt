1. Inputs X arrive through the preconnected path
2. The input is modeled using true weights W, weights are usually chosen randomly
3. Calculate the output of each neuron from the input layer to the hidden layer to the output layer
4. Calculate the error in the outputs
    Error = Actual Output - Desired Output

5. From the output layer, go back to the hidden layer to adjust the weights to reduce the error.
6. Repeat the process until the desired output is achieved.
